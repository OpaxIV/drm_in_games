# Analysis of the Resident Evil 2 Binary

## About the game
The game was purchased directly from steam.

## Analysis Procedure
During the analysis, the goal is to identify individual components of the DRM-system of Steam in the binary of RE2. At the beginning, the graph view shall be used to get a broad idea of the binary. In a further step the most important components of the XX obfuscation shall be identified. Some of these components shall be analysed further and presented in this file.

The binary has been analysed with the reverse engineering tool IDA64 (because Ghidra would be sluggish to use with an 150 Mb binary).
