# Analysis of the Function at 0x140084480

## Troubleshooting
If for any reason (as in my case), the function is non existant or not recognized by your disassembly program, follow these steps:
<br>
<br>
**Binary Ninja:**
- Search and input the address `0x1401f5a12` by hitting "G".
- In the hex view, mark the 48th byte
- Right click on it and choose make function ... -> default
<br>

<br>
If the above steps did not solve the issue, try "Analysis" --> "Run Linear Sweep"
<br>
<br>

**IDA64:**
- Search and input the address `0x1401f5a12` by hitting "G".
- Mark the disassembly (or whatever IDA did at this address), hit "C" to change to code and then "P" to create a function

## Graph View <a name="graphview"></a>

@ fabio: entry_0x140084480.md is entry point


_Note: In Binary Ninja, choose "Graph" and then "Disassembly" on the toolbar in the middle._
<br>
To get a rough overview of the function, a look at the graph view is provided:

Compared to some other analysed functions, this sample does not really provide a graph as in the "traditional" sense. BinaryNinja presents us one big chunk of disassembly, placed in only one basic block. This is certainly unusual compared to control flow graphs of traditional programs, but also compared to other obfuscated functions.

## Control Flow Analysis & Disassembly <a name="controlflowanalysis"></a>
The flow of this function seems to be pretty linear when looking at the disassembly.
```asm

### Unusual Instructions
XXX
<br>
`1401f5aeb  cvtsi2sd xmm4, esi`
<br>
The instruction `cvtsi2sd` is used when computing a signed doubleword integer (or signed quadword integer if operand size is 64 bits) into a double precision floating-point value. The result is stored in the low quadword of the destination operand, and the high quadword left unchanged. So in this case the CPU would fetch the value from `esi` and write it in the lower bits of `xmm4`. 

Expanding on the description of this characteristic, we find the  following two instructions:
<br>
`1401f5b43  ucomisd xmm0, xmm2`, which computes "an unordered compare of the double precision floating-point values in the low quadwords of operand 1 (first operand) and operand 2 (second operand)".
<br>
`1401f5b0a  movapd  xmm2, xmm4`, which "moves 2, 4 or 8 double precision floating-point values from the source operand (second operand) to the destination operand (first operand)".
<br>

### Large Values
Finally we can see that rather large numbers are being loaded at multiple locations. Some (but not all) examples include:

```asm
XXX
```
This could also be a case, where the program modifies or manipulates generated keys, which are then being used for some verification processes in the game's program.
<br>

## Type of Obfuscated Code <a name="typeofobfuscation"></a>
BinaryNinja presents us with the following pseudo C-code:
```C
   XXX
```
As we can see in the code, multiple variables are modified for many consecutive instructions. To elaborate further on this point, let us look at some of these variables.

### zmm9 & zmm10
Focussing on the first interesting variable `zmm9`, the following "high level" code is presented to us:
```C
[...]
XXX
```
When computed into something more readable, we get the following expression for `zmm9`:
<br>
`zmm9 = (rax >> 6) * (7.4505805969238281e-09)`
<br>
When going further, we can see that the very same variable is also used in the context of
```C
[...]
9 @ 1401f5a90  int128_t zmm10;
10 @ 1401f5a90  zmm10 = (zmm9 * zmm9);
[...]
```
which let us then rewrite the computation for `zmm10`.
<br>
`zmm10 = (((rax >> 6) * (7.4505805969238281e-09)) * ((rax >> 6) * (7.4505805969238281e-09)));`
<br>

### zmm4 & zmm2
Based on the same principle, we can rewrite the values `zmm4` and `zmm2` into the following expressions
```C
[...]
12 @ 1401f5aeb  int128_t zmm4;
13 @ 1401f5aeb  zmm4 = ((double)(rax >> 5));
14 @ 1401f5b06  zmm4 = (zmm4 * 7.4505805969238281e-09);
[...]
```
which leads to `zmm4 = ((rax >> 5) * 7.4505805969238281e-09)`.
<br>
<br>
Elaborating furher will lead us to the rewritten expression for `zmm2`:
```C
[...]
15 @ 1401f5b18  int128_t zmm2;
16 @ 1401f5b18  zmm2 = (zmm4 + zmm4);
--> zmm2 = (((rax >> 5) * 7.4505805969238281e-09) + ((rax >> 5) * 7.4505805969238281e-09))

17 @ 1401f5b25  zmm2 = (zmm2 + -1.0);
--> zmm2 = (((rax >> 5) * 7.4505805969238281e-09) + ((rax >> 5) * 7.4505805969238281e-09)) + -1.0

18 @ 1401f5b29  zmm2 = (zmm2 * zmm4);
--> zmm2 = ((((rax >> 5) * 7.4505805969238281e-09) + ((rax >> 5) * 7.4505805969238281e-09)) + -1.0) * ((rax >> 5) * 7.4505805969238281e-09)

19 @ 1401f5b2d  zmm2 = (zmm2 + -1.0);
--> zmm2 = ((((rax >> 5) * 7.4505805969238281e-09) + ((rax >> 5) * 7.4505805969238281e-09)) + -1.0) * ((rax >> 5) * 7.4505805969238281e-09) + -1.0
[...]
```
So the final expression for `zmm2` would be 
<br>
`zmm2 = ((((rax >> 5) * 7.4505805969238281e-09) + ((rax >> 5) * 7.4505805969238281e-09)) + -1.0) * ((rax >> 5) * 7.4505805969238281e-09) + -1.0`.
<br>

**This encapsulation of expressions leads to the assumption of the code being of the type of Arithmetic Encoding.**




## Appendix <a name="appendix"></a>
Some further information, not really fitting directly into the text of the analysis:
### Indirect jump:
Depending of the processor architecture, the assembly instruction for an indirect jump looks like the following:
- x86 (AT&T Syntax):      	`jmp *%eax`
- x86 (Intel Syntax):      	`jmp eax`

### Streaming SIMD Extensions
Streaming SIMD Extensions (SSE) is a single instruction, multiple data (SIMD) instruction set extension to the x86 architecture, designed by Intel and introduced in 1999 in their Pentium III series of central processing units (CPUs) shortly after the appearance of Advanced Micro Devices (AMD's) 3DNow!.
SSE originally added eight new 128-bit registers known as XMM0 through XMM7. The AMD64 extensions from AMD (originally called x86-64) added a further eight registers XMM8 through XMM15, and this extension is duplicated in the Intel 64 architecture. There is also a new 32-bit control/status register, MXCSR. The registers XMM8 through XMM15 are accessible only in 64-bit operating mode.
