The function at `0x140084480` is the entry point of the program. When looking further into it, we can see the following graph (minimized to fit everyhing in one picture):

All the present arrows in the graph show multiple control flow combinations, which may or may not be taken.

### Entry Point
By definition an entry point is the place in a program where the execution of a program begins. In the case of the binary, it would be this function at `0x140084480`. When talking about the function specifically, then I took it upon myself to define the first compound of basic blocks as the entry point of this function (from `0x140084480` to `0x14036ffef`).

<br>
When this function is run, the basic blocks of the entry point are the only ones guaranteed to be exectuted in every cycle.
<br>
In this part already we can spot some similarities to some of the other analysed functions.
Firstly, the manipulation of rather big numbers is found at the addresses `0x14036ffb3` and `14036ffbd`.
<br>
```asm
[...]
14036ffb3  mov     rdi, 0x3e40000000000000
14036ffbd  movq    xmm14, rdi  {0x3e40000000000000}
[...]
```
<br>
Furthermore, we can see some unusual instructions being used like for example `cvtsi2sd` and `comisd`. The description of these two instructions is not further elaborated, since both of them have been mentioned already in the analysis of the function at `0x1401f5a12` [Click](easyanticheat/functions_analysis/0x1401f5a12.md).
<br>
The entry point then finished 



## Type of Obfuscated Code <a name="typeofobfuscation"></a>
BinaryNinja presents us with the following pseudo C-code:
```C
   XXX
```


**This encapsulation of expressions leads to the assumption of the code being of the type of Arithmetic Encoding.**

#### offene fragen
@tim:
- bsp 14036ffbd  movq    xmm14, rdi  {0x3e40000000000000} / 14036ffc2  mulsd   xmm9, xmm14 --> differenz ungleich da dazwischen noch "versteckte" instruktionen sind?
