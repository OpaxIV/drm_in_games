The function at `0x140084480` is the entry point of the program. When looking further into it, we can see the following graph (minimized to fit everyhing in one picture):

All the present arrows in the graph show multiple control flow combinations, which may or may not be taken.

### Entry Point
By definition an entry point is the place in a program where the execution of a program begins. In the case of the binary, it would be this function at `0x140084480`. When talking about the function specifically, then I took it upon myself to define the first compound of basic blocks as the entry point of this function (from `0x140084480` to `0x14036ffef`).
<br>
<img src="https://github.com/OpaxIV/hslu_secproj/assets/93701325/12e42b3e-f4cd-4bd3-816d-c45c27bf9719" width="500">
<br>
When this function is run, the basic blocks of the entry point are the only ones guaranteed to be exectuted in every cycle.
<br>
In this part already we can spot some similarities to some of the other analysed functions.
Firstly, the manipulation of rather big numbers is found at the addresses `0x14036ffb3` and `14036ffbd`.
<br>
```asm
[...]
14036ffb3  mov     rdi, 0x3e40000000000000
14036ffbd  movq    xmm14, rdi  {0x3e40000000000000}
[...]
```
<br>
Furthermore, we can see some unusual instructions being used like for example `cvtsi2sd` and `comisd`. The description of these two instructions will not be further elaborated, since both of them (or a slight variation) have been mentioned already in the analysis of the function at `0x1401f5a12` (<a href="0x1401f5a12.md">Click</a>).
<br>
The entry point then finishes with a comparasion `14036ffd0  comisd  xmm9, xmm14` and a jump `14036ffef  jb      0x14016e830`, if the result is negative. This leads to two paths, which might be taken: One starting from `0x14036fff5` and finishing at `0x140159ac6`, and the other directly jumping from `0x14036ffef` to `0x14016e830`.

### jb is executed
If the preceding comparison holds, hence resulting in a "true", the jump leading directly to `0x14016e830` is taken. There is not much to say about this subpath, since it's a direct jump to the exit point, which will be analyzed further in one of the next chapters.

### jb is not executed
The following paragraph will only highlight some important aspects of this subpath.
This subpath is taken, if the preceding comparison returns a "false". The whole subpath starts at `0x14036fff5` and ends at `0x140159ac6`.
<br>
<br>

By looking at the first set of basic blocks from `0x14036fff5` to `0x1402ae2af` we can see the following:
<br>
<img src="https://github.com/OpaxIV/hslu_secproj/assets/93701325/ecb33b63-7e85-49c3-ab4d-be1de12b5f98" width="300">
<br>
The flow is pretty straight forward until `0x1402ae29e`.
```asm
1402ae29e  and     rbp, r15
1402ae2a1  xor     r15, rdx
1402ae2a4  add     rbp, rbp
1402ae2a7  mov     rdx, rbp
1402ae2aa  movq    rdi, xmm8
1402ae2af  jne     0x1402ae29e
```
In here we can see a `1402ae2af  jne     0x1402ae29e` (jump not equal), which in this case is not proceded by a `cmp` instruction. As per definition, the `jne` checks the Zero Flag (ZF): If ZF==0 holds true, hence both values are not equal, then a jump occurs. Due to the lack of a `cmp` instruction, `jne` checks the ZF, which was lastely manipulated by the `1402ae2a4  add     rbp, rbp` instruction. The `add` instruction sets the ZF flag accordingly, if the summation of both operands are equal to zero (ZF=1) or not (ZF=0).
In this case a loop occurs every time that the addition of the values in `rdp` being equal to zero.

Going on further, let us get a closer look of the next set of basic blocks from `0x1402ae2b5` to `0x14012887e`:
<br>

<br>
I would say, that there is nothing really unusual in this disassembly. One could again point out the usage of a rather large number at `140128843  mov     rax, 0xfffffffffee82729`. 
<br>
<br>

Starting at `0x140426de4` and continuing to `0x14028122c` we can see:
<br>
<img src="https://github.com/OpaxIV/hslu_secproj/assets/93701325/c45f0dc8-18e1-46e4-a87f-6928c4f3d85a" width="300">
<br>
In here we have a similar scenario like `0x1402ae29e`. A loop occurs only if the `jne` instruction is satisfied. This can bee seen again at `0x14028121a`.
<br>
<br>
The last set of basic blocks consists of the ones from `0x1407129ed` to `0x140159ac6`.
<br>
<img src="https://github.com/OpaxIV/hslu_secproj/assets/93701325/d709869a-5091-46dd-bba1-648b65c20cfb" width="400">
<br>
The loop, which already occured multiple times before, reappears again at `0x1403d45dd`. It is again an addition, which decides, if the "jump not equal" is taken.
<br>
## Exit Point
<br>
<img src="https://github.com/OpaxIV/hslu_secproj/assets/93701325/cee051ae-0127-4f09-b7bb-43dcb069ca23" width="500">
<br>
In the exit point we can spot multiple interesting things: For starters, we can again spot multiple manipulations of large numbers (and the registers containing them).
```asm
[...]
14016e84f  mov     rax, 0xfffffffffec73490
14016e859  mov     rdx, rax  {0xfffffffffec73490}
14016e85c  mov     rbx, rdx  {0xfffffffffec73490}
[...]
```
<br>
Secondly there is again the `jne` loop, which in this case gets initiated by the `1401db6ee  add     rdx, rdx` instruction.
Finally there is an usual beviour: Instead of returning or at least jumping to another address, the function 
- jmp rcx --> unusual

## Type of Obfuscated Code <a name="typeofobfuscation"></a>
BinaryNinja presents us with the following pseudo C-code:
```C

**This encapsulation of expressions leads to the assumption of the code being of the type of Arithmetic Encoding.**

@tim:
- bsp 14036ffbd  movq    xmm14, rdi  {0x3e40000000000000} / 14036ffc2  mulsd   xmm9, xmm14 --> differenz ungleich da dazwischen noch "versteckte" instruktionen sind?
