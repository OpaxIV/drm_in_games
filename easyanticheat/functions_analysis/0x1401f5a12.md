# Analysis of the Function at 0x1401f5a12

## Troubleshooting
If for any reason (as in my case), the function is non existant or not recognized by your disassembly program, follow these steps:
<br>
<br>
**Binary Ninja:**
- Search and input the address `0x1401f5a12` by hitting "G".
- In the hex view, mark the 48th byte
- Right click on it and choose make function ... -> default
<br>

<br>
If the above steps did not solve the issue, try "Analysis" --> "Run Linear Sweep"
<br>
<br>

**IDA64:**
- Search and input the address `0x1401f5a12` by hitting "G".
- Mark the disassembly (or whatever IDA did at this address), hit "C" to change to code and then "P" to create a function

## Graph View <a name="graphview"></a>
_Note: In Binary Ninja, choose "Graph" and then "Disassembly" on the toolbar in the middle._
To get a rough overview of the function, a look at the graph view is provided:

Compared to some other analysed functions, this sample does not really provide a graph as in the "traditional" sense. BinaryNinja presents us one big chunk of disassembly, placed in only one basic block. This is certainly unusual compared to control flow graphs of traditional programs, but also compared to other obfuscated functions.

## Control Flow Analysis & Disassembly <a name="controlflowanalysis"></a>
The flow of this function seems to be pretty linear when looking at the disassembly.

There are no compare or jump instructions except for the last instruction `jmp     rsi` at `0x1401f5b6a`, which is called an "indirect jump". An indirect jump specifies where the address of the next instruction is located, rather than the address of the next instruction to execute, as in a direct branch. In this case the address of the next instruction to execute would be located in the register `%rsi`. However the address to be jumped to is not known until the instruction is executed.
Normally an indirect jump would point to a jump table, which is used in switch cases.
<br>
Another characteristic to point out are the unsusual instructions found troughout this function. 
`1401f5aeb  cvtsi2sd xmm4, esi`
The instruction `cvtsi2sd` is used 


@ fabio: rewrite
Converts a signed doubleword integer (or signed quadword integer if operand size is 64 bits) in the “convert-from” source operand to a double precision floating-point value in the destination operand. The result is stored in the low quadword of the destination operand, and the high quadword left unchanged. When conversion is inexact, the value returned is rounded according to the rounding control bits in the MXCSR register.


`1401f5b43  ucomisd xmm0, xmm2`

`1401f5b56  cmovbe  rsi, r13  {0xfffffffffffdf92c}`

<br>
Finally we can see that rather large numbers are being loaded at multiple locations. Some (but not all) examples include:

```asm
[...]
1401f5a12  mov     rcx, 0xfffffffffcc0dfe6
[...]
1401f5a6e  mov     rbp, 0x3e40000000000000
[...]
1401f5a78  movq    xmm10, rbp  {0x3e40000000000000}
[...]
```
This could also be a case, where the program modifies or manipulates generated keys, which are then being used for some verification processes in the game's program.

## Type of Obfuscated Code <a name="typeofobfuscation"></a>
BinaryNinja presents us with the following pseudo C-code:
```C
   0 @ 1401f5a26  sub_1404a66fa(-0x33f201a);
   1 @ 1401f5a2f  int32_t rax;
   2 @ 1401f5a2f  int64_t rcx;
   3 @ 1401f5a2f  rax = arg2();
   4 @ 1401f5a41  int64_t (* var_8)(int64_t arg1 @ zmm5, int128_t arg2 @ zmm8) = sub_1404a66fa;
   5 @ 1401f5a50  int128_t zmm9;
   6 @ 1401f5a50  int128_t var_18 = zmm9;
   7 @ 1401f5a69  zmm9 = ((double)(rax >> 6));
   8 @ 1401f5a7d  zmm9 = (zmm9 * 7.4505805969238281e-09);
   9 @ 1401f5a90  int128_t zmm10;
  10 @ 1401f5a90  zmm10 = (zmm9 * zmm9);
  11 @ 1401f5ab4  *(uint64_t*)((char*)var_18)[8] = rcx;
  12 @ 1401f5aeb  int128_t zmm4;
  13 @ 1401f5aeb  zmm4 = ((double)(rax >> 5));
  14 @ 1401f5b06  zmm4 = (zmm4 * 7.4505805969238281e-09);
  15 @ 1401f5b18  int128_t zmm2;
  16 @ 1401f5b18  zmm2 = (zmm4 + zmm4);
  17 @ 1401f5b25  zmm2 = (zmm2 + -1.0);
  18 @ 1401f5b29  zmm2 = (zmm2 * zmm4);
  19 @ 1401f5b2d  zmm2 = (zmm2 + -1.0);
  20 @ 1401f5b31  int64_t rsi_2 = -0x96535a;
  21 @ 1401f5b3f  int128_t zmm0;
  22 @ 1401f5b3f  zmm0 = (zmm4 * zmm4);
  23 @ 1401f5b56  if (zmm0 <= zmm2)
  23 @ 1401f5b43  {
[...]
```
As we can see in the following code, multiple variables are modified for many consecutive instructions. To elaborate further on this point, let us look at some of these variables.

### zmm9 & zmm10
Focussing only on the first interesting variable `zmm9` (named by BinaryNinja), the following "high level" code is presented to us: 
```C
5 @ 1401f5a50  int128_t zmm9;
6 @ 1401f5a50  int128_t var_18 = zmm9;  
7 @ 1401f5a69  zmm9 = ((double)(rax >> 6));
8 @ 1401f5a7d  zmm9 = (zmm9 * 7.4505805969238281e-09);
```
When computed in something more readable, we get the following expression for `zmm9`:
<br>
`zmm9 = (rax >> 6) * (7.4505805969238281e-09)`
<br>
When going on further, we can see that the very same variables is also used in the context of:
``` 
9 @ 1401f5a90  int128_t zmm10;
10 @ 1401f5a90  zmm10 = (zmm9 * zmm9);
```
Which let us then rewrite the computation for `zmm10`:
`zmm10 = (((rax >> 6) * (7.4505805969238281e-09)) * ((rax >> 6) * (7.4505805969238281e-09)));`

### zmm4 & zmm2



Arithmetic Encoding




## Appendix <a name="appendix"></a>
Some further information, not really fitting directly into the text of the analysis:
### Indirect jump:
Depending of the processor architecture, the assembly instruction for an indirect jump looks like the following:
- x86 (AT&T Syntax):      	`jmp *%eax`
- x86 (Intel Syntax):      	`jmp eax`
