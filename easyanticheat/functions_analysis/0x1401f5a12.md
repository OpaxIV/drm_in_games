## Graph View <a name="graphview"></a>
To get a rough overview of the function, a look at the graph view is provided:

As one can see, there are multiple branches (conditionals) which might be taken. There are basically two ways the control flow can go: Either by the "construction" on the left with the various conditional jumps, or the right side which is more or less a direct jump to the last basic block `0x140001133`.
