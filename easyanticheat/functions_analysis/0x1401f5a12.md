# Analysis of the Function at 0x1401f5a12

@fabio 2do
## Troubleshooting
- ida: --> 0x140084480 / 0x1401f5a12  --> C (change to code) --> P (create function)
- BinaryNinja:  
- BinaryNija: alternativ auch versuchen mit Analysis --> run linear sweep

If for any reason (as in my case), the function is non existant or not recognized by your disassembly program, follow these steps:
Binary Ninja:
- Search and input the address `0x1401f5a12` by hitting `G`.
- In the hex view, mark the 48th byte
- Right click on it and choose make function ... -> default

IDA64:
- Search and input the address `0x1401f5a12` by hitting `G`.
- Mark the disassembly

## Graph View <a name="graphview"></a>
_Note: In Binary Ninja, choose "Graph" and then "Disassembly" on the toolbar in the middle._
To get a rough overview of the function, a look at the graph view is provided:

As one can see, there are multiple branches (conditionals) which might be taken. There are basically two ways the control flow can go: Either by the "construction" on the left with the various conditional jumps, or the right side which is more or less a direct jump to the last basic block `0x140001133`.
