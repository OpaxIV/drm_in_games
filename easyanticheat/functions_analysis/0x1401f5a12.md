## Graph View
To get a rough overview of the function, a look at the graph view is provided:

As one can see, there are multiple branches (conditionals) which might be taken. There are basically two ways the control flow can go: Either by the "construction" on the left with the various conditional jumps, or the right side which is more or less a direct jump to the last basic block `0x140001133`.

## Control Flow Analysis & Disassembly
Besides the usual stack preparations, we can see a conditional jump at `0x140001027`. Either the value located in memory at `[rax]` is equal to `6` (hence the result being 6 - [rax] == 0) or not. A "more direct" jump would only occur if the result is not zero (`jnz     loc_140001131`).
```asm
[...]

[...]
```
### [rax] == 6
The more complex path is taken, if `[rax]` is equal to the value`6`.

<br/>

The "false"-branch is executed, hence leading the path onto the address `0x14000102D`.
```asm

```
In here we can see that a rather large number `0x0FFFFF7800000027` (suffix removed) is being copied into the register `rax`. Converted into an integer this value would be interchangeable with `1152920920491294759`.
Afterwards some computation is executed by loading the effective address of `[rdi+1]` into `ebx`.
The value in register `ebx` is the compared to the location in memory at `[rax]`. If they do not compute to the same value, hence resulting in `ebx` - `[rax]` != 0, the control flow continues at the address `0x140001131`, the same as in the proceding outermost right branch:
<br>

<br/>
On the other hand, if the opration `ebx` - `[rax]` is actually equal to zero, then the jump occurs into the basic block that follows at `0x140001042`. In here, some sort of (byte) array is compared to the value in the `dil` register (part of `edi`).
```asm
.text:0000000140001042 cmp     cs:byte_14007B170, dil
.text:0000000140001049 jnz     loc_14000110B
```
Again, if the comparasion does not result in zero, a jump is taken to the basic block at `0x14000110B`. If not, then the control flow gets redirected to the block which follows at  `0x14000104F`.
In the disassembly of this very basic block one can see multiple operations, which seem to be executed in conjunction with an array:
```asm

```
Starting from `0x14000106B` to `0x14000106B` many instructions contain a `mov` operation, in which values get copied into memory locations (referenced by `[rbp + offset]`). 
```asm
[...]

[...]
```
This can also be seen in the generated psuedo C-code:
```C
[...]
[...]
```
In the end another array (`v5` in the pseudo C-code) is filled with zeros. The C function `void *memset(void *str, int c, size_t n)` copies an integer (interpreted as an unsigned char) into the defined array (pointer `*str` to the memory block to fill), and also receiving the integer's size by the parameter `size_t`.
As seen in the pseudo C-code,
```C
[...]

[...]
```
and the disassembly.
```asm
[...]
[...]
```
The control flow then reaches the basic block `0x1400010C5`. Most notable are the many `xor` and arithmetic shfit operations which occur:
```asm
[...]
.text:00000001400010C7 shl     ecx, 0Dh
.text:00000001400010CA xor     ecx, edx
.text:00000001400010CC mov     eax, ecx
.text:00000001400010CE shr     eax, 7
.text:00000001400010D1 xor     ecx, eax
.text:00000001400010D3 mov     rax, [rbp+arg_0]
.text:00000001400010D7 mov     edx, ecx
.text:00000001400010D9 shl     edx, 11h
.text:00000001400010DC xor     edx, ecx
.text:00000001400010DE ror     edx, 4
.text:00000001400010E1 mov     ecx, edx
.text:00000001400010E3 xor     ecx, [rax+rdi]
.text:00000001400010E6 mov     rax, [rbp+arg_8]
.text:00000001400010EA mov     [rax+rdi], ecx```
[...]
```
This can also be clearly seen in the pseudo C-code.

```C
v1 = __ROR4__(
           ((v1 ^ (unsigned int)(v1 << 13)) >> 7) ^ v1 ^ (v1 << 13) ^ ((((v1 ^ (unsigned int)(v1 << 13)) >> 7) ^ v1 ^ (v1 << 13)) << 17),
           4);
    *(_DWORD *)((char *)v5 + v0) = *(int *)((char *)v4 + v0) ^ v1;
```
Finally a jump `jb      short loc_1400010C5` is executed, if the value in `rdi` is equal to `0x2C`. The whole procedure is repeated in the opposite's case.

Following the "true"-branch we reach the basic block at `0x1400010F7`. In here a subroutine `sub_140008B54` is called and afterwards the zero flag gets modified. The value in `rax` is modified by an AND operation (`test    rax, rax`). The ZF flag is set to 1 if `%rax AND %rax == 0`. Depending of the case we either jump to the block on the left or right:
<br>

<br/>

Skipping over some basic blocks we can see at `0x14000111D` that the value of `eax` is copied into the (byte) array.
```asm
[...]
text:000000014000111D movzx   eax, cs:byte_14007B170
.text:0000000140001124 test    dl, dl
.text:0000000140001126 cmovnz  eax, ebx
.text:0000000140001129 mov     cs:byte_14007B170, al
.text:000000014000112F jmp     short loc_140001133
```


### [rax] != 6
If the condition is true, hence `[rax]` being not equal to `6`, a jump is taken from `0x140001027` to `0x140001131`:
<br>
<img src="https://github.com/OpaxIV/hslu_secproj/assets/93701325/91b0c923-b6f9-4153-abd0-df13fcd56613" width="500">
<br/>

In here the register `al` is altered by an `xor    al, al` operation, which in addition also modifies the 64-bit register `rax` and 32-bit register `eax`.
<br>
<img src="https://github.com/OpaxIV/hslu_secproj/assets/93701325/044dad9e-607e-4dfd-b31b-df4bf3069bc0" width="400">
<br/>


### Function Exit
Both branch sets finally reach the basic block at `0x140001133`. Some variables get written into the registers `r11`, `rbx` and `rdi` respectively. The stack is restored by copying the value of `r11` (`[rsp+80h+var_s0]`) into `rsp` and by popping `rbp`.
```asm
[...]
.text:0000000140001133
.text:0000000140001133 loc_140001133:
.text:0000000140001133 lea     r11, [rsp+80h+var_s0]
.text:000000014000113B mov     rbx, [r11+20h]
.text:000000014000113F mov     rdi, [r11+28h]
.text:0000000140001143 mov     rsp, r11
.text:0000000140001146 pop     rbp
.text:0000000140001147 retn
.text:0000000140001147 sub_140001000 endp
.text:0000000140001147
[...]
```
The function then returns.


## Type of Obfuscated Code
An in dept analysis of the function's code has been presented. It is assumed that this function implements some sort of artithmetic encoding. The basis of such an obfuscation technique is the replacement of integer arithmetics with more complex expressions, encoded with "Mixed Boolean Expressions". 
An example would be:
```
x + y = x - ¬ y - 1
      = (x ⊕ y) + 2·(x ∧ y) 
      = (x ∨ y) + (x ∧ y) 
      = 2·(x ∨ y) - (x ⊕ y)
```
Which would be translated into:

```
With (z = x + y + w)

z = (((x ^ y) + ((x & y) << 1)) | w) + 
    (((x ^ y) + ((x & y) << 1)) & w);
```

This similarity can be found in the function by looking at the following code snipplets:
```C
[...]
v1 = __ROR4__(
           ((v1 ^ (unsigned int)(v1 << 13)) >> 7) ^ v1 ^ (v1 << 13) ^ ((((v1 ^ (unsigned int)(v1 << 13)) >> 7) ^ v1 ^ (v1 << 13)) << 17),
           4);
[...]
```

```asm

```
The sheer amount of XOR and artithmetic shift operations further underline this assumption.
