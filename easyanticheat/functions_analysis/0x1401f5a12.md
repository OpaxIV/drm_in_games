# Analysis of the Function at 0x1401f5a12

## Troubleshooting
If for any reason (as in my case), the function is non existant or not recognized by your disassembly program, follow these steps:
Binary Ninja:
- Search and input the address `0x1401f5a12` by hitting "G".
- In the hex view, mark the 48th byte
- Right click on it and choose make function ... -> default

If the above steps did not solve the issue, try "Analysis" --> "Run Linear Sweep"

IDA64:
- Search and input the address `0x1401f5a12` by hitting "G".
- Mark the disassembly (or whatever IDA did at this address), hit "C" to change to code and then "P" to create a function

## Graph View <a name="graphview"></a>
_Note: In Binary Ninja, choose "Graph" and then "Disassembly" on the toolbar in the middle._
To get a rough overview of the function, a look at the graph view is provided:

Compared to some other analysed functions, this samples does not really provide a graph as in the "traditional" sense. BinaryNinja presents us one big chunk of disassembly, placed in only one basic block.
