# Analysis of the function sub_140004EF0
The first function to look at can be found at the address `0x140004EFE`. By looking at the graph view we can see some conditional jumps:

Interesting to understand would be, if this would be a possible candidate for an opaque predicate. This would imply, that some conditional branches are in fact "dead braches", which would never be executed.
To prove this assumption, we would need to look further into these basic blocks, which contain the conditional jumps.
## Very Short Analysis
As en example, the first conditional jump is to be found in the basic block at `0x140004EFE`:
```asm
.text:0000000140004EF0
.text:0000000140004EF0
.text:0000000140004EF0
.text:0000000140004EF0 sub_140004EF0 proc near
.text:0000000140004EF0 sub     rsp, 28h
.text:0000000140004EF4 mov     rax, cs:qword_14007E2F8
.text:0000000140004EFB test    rax, rax
.text:0000000140004EFE jnz     short loc_140004F52
```
The important part here would be the `test rax, rax` instruction, by which the control flow is controlled. Generally speaking, in the x86 assembly language, the `TEST` instruction performs a bitwise AND on two operands. If the result is 0, the Zero Flag (ZF) is set to 1, otherwise set to 0.<br>
An example would be the following:
```asm
; Conditional Jump with NOT
test cl, cl   ; set ZF to 1 if cl == 0
jnz 0x8004f430  ; jump if ZF == 0, hence cl != 0
```
To know if the branch is executed, we would need to check, whether the value of `rax` fulfills this condition. However a static analysis cannot state the needed information.

## Conclusion
In the case of our disassembly, we would need to check each conditional branch to see, if some of them can be classified as dead branches. In a further step it would be necessary to check all values contained in relevant registers (e.g. `rax` in the above example).
**To clearly classify this function as an opaque predicate, one should look further into it, e.g. during an dynamic programm analysis.**
