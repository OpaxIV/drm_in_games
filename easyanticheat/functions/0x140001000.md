# Analysis of the Function at 0x140001000
## Graph View
To get a rough overview of the function, a look at the graph view is provided:

As one can see, there are multiple branches (conditionals) which might be taken. There are basically two ways the control flow can go: Either by the "construction" on the left with the various conditional jumps, or the right side which is more or less a direct jump to the last basic block `0x140001133`.

## Detail Analysis of the Control Flow
Besides the usual stack preparations, we can see a conditional jump at `0x140001027`. Either the value located in memory at `[rax]` is equal to `6` (hence the result being 6 - [rax] == 0) or not. A "more direct" jump would only occur if the result is not zero (`jnz     loc_140001131`).
```asm
[...]
.text:0000000140001000 mov     [rsp-8+arg_10], rbx
.text:0000000140001005 mov     [rsp-8+arg_18], rdi
.text:000000014000100A push    rbp
.text:000000014000100B mov     rbp, rsp
.text:000000014000100E sub     rsp, 80h
.text:0000000140001015 xor     edi, edi
.text:0000000140001017 mov     rax, 0FFFFF7800000026Ch
.text:0000000140001021 mov     dword ptr [rbp+arg_0], edi
.text:0000000140001024 cmp     dword ptr [rax], 6
.text:0000000140001027 jnz     loc_140001131

```
### [rax] == 6



### [rax] != 6
If the condition is true, hence `[rax]` being not equal to `6`, a jump is taken from `0x140001027` to `0x140001131`:

In here the register `al` is altered by an `xor    al, al` operation, which in addition also modifies the 64-bit register `rax` and 32-bit register `eax`.

### Basic Block at 0x140001133
Both branch sets sent finally reach the basic block at `0x140001133`
