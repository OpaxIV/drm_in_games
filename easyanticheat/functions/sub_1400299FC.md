# Analysis of the function sub_1400299FC
When opening the function at 0x1400299FC we can already spot some similarities to the vm-based obfuscation technique.

<br/>
The high amount of branches which all lead to a central point, would point us further to this conclusion. To elaborate further on this point, we need to analyse the function in greater detail. At first we need to make assumptions about the functioning of the individual components to see if they could map to the functional parts of a vm-based obfuscation.
<br>

## VM-Entry (?)
At first we can see some sort of vm-entry directly at the beginning of the function:

<br/>
By looking further into the disassembly we can see the usual "preparations" when a function is called, in e.g. the pushing of registers and making of space on the stack.

### Subroutine 0x1400586C0
Most notable is at the address `0x140029A38`, at which a subroutine is called, leading to `0x1400586C0`:
<br>
<img src="https://github.com/OpaxIV/hslu_secproj/assets/93701325/f786dc97-0361-4965-95d5-b1e94b7cf09c" width="600">
<br/>
The first basic block contains a conditional jump, which is performed if the value in `r8` is greater than `0x8`, executing the left set of branches.
```asm
[...]
.text:00000001400586C3 cmp     r8, 8
.text:00000001400586C7 jb      short loc_140058710
[...]
```
#### Rigth Set of Branches
As we can see, the left set of branches is made up of three basic blocks:
<br>
<img src="https://github.com/OpaxIV/hslu_secproj/assets/93701325/7ff7a62c-a125-49d9-8343-b572f985e47a" width="400">
<br/>
It gives us two possibilities: If the value in register `r8` is equal to 0 (hence the result of the AND operation being 0), then we directly jump to the last basic block in the set at `0x140058720`. On the other hand, if `r8` is indeed not equal to 0, the control flow gets passed to the middle block and a loop occurs. This loop decrements the value of `r8` until it is equal to 0 (`dec     r8`), which finally also leads to the last basic block and returning us to the proceeding calling function.
<br>

#### Left Set of Branches
Now let us return to the original starting point of the function, at the main branching path at `0x1400586C0`. As we have two possibilites from here. The first path, if the outcome is true, has been explained in the proceeding paragraph. The second path, hence if the outcome is false, splits the main control flow again into two sub paths.
<br>
<img src="https://github.com/OpaxIV/hslu_secproj/assets/93701325/375f6956-0255-4651-a574-1503a6268494" width="500">
<br>

On the left side we have a similar construction as already seen in the proceeding paragraph: One or multiple register's value, in this case of `r9` and `r8`, are either decremented (`sub     r9, 8`) or modified (`and     r8, 7`) and then compared to 0. If the value is or is not equal to zero, then give the control over to another basic block. Afterwards the loop gets initiated again or the control flow goes on forward and finally returns to the calling function.

<br/>

#### Middle Set of Branches
Still in the subroutine, there is one more possible branch one can take. We looked at the right, left and now let us analyse the one in the center:
<br>
<img src="https://github.com/OpaxIV/hslu_secproj/assets/93701325/24e9cf59-9196-465e-9b8a-1544db47cf0d" width="500">

<br>

The first conditional jump is taken, if the value of `r9` (after bein decremented) is not equal to 0 (`jz      short loc_140058781`).
```C
[...]
 if ( v11 >> 7 )
      {
        do
        {
          *v10 = v8;
          v10[1] = v8;
          v10 += 8;
          v10[-6] = v8;
          v10[-5] = v8;
          --v12;
          v10[-4] = v8;
          v10[-3] = v8;
          v10[-2] = v8;
          v10[-1] = v8;
        }
        while ( v12 );
        v11 &= 0x7Fu;
      }
[...]
```
In the next basic block, the value of `r8` is modified by an `and     r8, 7Fh` operation.























#### Pseudo C-Code
The code for the analysis of the subroutine has mostly been taken from the disassembly. For the sake of completeness, the whole C pseudo code has been added for reference.
```C
__m128 *__fastcall sub_1400586C0(__m128 *a1, unsigned __int8 a2, unsigned __int64 a3)

  __m128 *result; // rax
  __int64 v4; // rdx
  unsigned __int64 v5; // r9
  char *v6; // rcx
  unsigned __int64 v7; // r8
  __m128 v8; // xmm0
  char *v9; // r8
  __m128 *v10; // rcx
  unsigned __int64 v11; // r8
  unsigned __int64 v12; // r9
  unsigned __int64 i; // r9
  __int64 v14; // r8

  result = a1;
  if ( a3 < 8 )
  {
    for ( ; a3; --a3 )
      a1->m128_i8[a3 - 1] = a2;
  }
  else
  {
    v4 = 0x101010101010101i64 * a2;
    if ( a3 >= 0x4F )
    {
      v8 = _mm_movelh_ps((__m128)(unsigned __int64)v4, (__m128)(unsigned __int64)v4);
      *a1 = v8;
      v9 = (char *)a1 + a3;
      v10 = (__m128 *)((unsigned __int64)&a1[1] & 0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF0ui64);
      v11 = v9 - (char *)v10;
      v12 = v11 >> 7;
      if ( v11 >> 7 )
      {
        do
        {
          *v10 = v8;
          v10[1] = v8;
          v10 += 8;
          v10[-6] = v8;
          v10[-5] = v8;
          --v12;
          v10[-4] = v8;
          v10[-3] = v8;
          v10[-2] = v8;
          v10[-1] = v8;
        }
        while ( v12 );
        v11 &= 0x7Fu;
      }
      for ( i = v11 >> 4; i; --i )
        *v10++ = v8;
      v14 = v11 & 0xF;
      if ( v14 )
        *(__m128 *)((char *)v10 + v14 - 16) = v8;
    }
    else
    {
      v5 = a3 & 0x78;
      v6 = (char *)a1 + (a3 & 0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF8ui64);
      do
      {
        *(unsigned __int64 *)((char *)&result->m128_u64[-1] + v5) = v4;
        v5 -= 8i64;
      }
      while ( v5 );
      v7 = a3 & 7;
      if ( v7 )
        *(_QWORD *)&v6[v7 - 8] = v4;
    }
  }
  return result;
}
