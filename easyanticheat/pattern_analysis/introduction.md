# Pattern Analysis
After having consulted multiple writeups and analysed a set of functions from programs, the idea of the following writeup is document the steps, that are used to quickly identify obfuscated code in a binary. It is certain, that a professional might use other ways to complete this task. This document should provide in insight in the procedure from a beginner's point of view.

## Analysis Procedure <a name="analysisprocedure"></a>
The goal is to quickly find and identify obfuscated code in the binary. Hence the idea is to go trough the list of functions and trying to find a set of functions, which contain some general classifiers for obfuscated code: 
- The function is only made up by a single basic block.
- The function contains rare or unusual instructions in the disassembly.
- The function's code does not represent "normal / usual" code.

This analysis shall cover a handfull of functions, which are indeed obfuscated and to make a point, some functions which were correctly identified as not being obfuscated.
