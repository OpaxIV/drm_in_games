## Opaque Predicates
Note: Due to an unknown error in tigress, no samples could be generated with the "AddOpaque" option.
Hence another sample has been taken for analysis (referenced bellow).

### General Definition

In computer science, predicates are conditional expressions that evaluate to true or false. An opaque predicates value (outcome) is kown to the obfuscator at the time of obfuscation, but difficult to find out externally at a later point in time. 
Using opaque predicates will lead to an extremely excessive control flow graph with redudant inexecutable paths.
It is for this reason, that any further analysis based on the control flow graph will turn into tedious work.
In comparasion to other control flow graph obfuscation techniques, opaque predicates act more covert, since it is difficult to separate them from actual functional code in the program.

#### Opaque Expressions
Opaque predicates can be classified as the following types:

_P<sup>T</sup> - opaquely true predicate_ <br>
The condition is always satisfied, hence "true". The following example shows, that either expression `2` or `(x^2 + x)^T` must be correct. Since `2` is always true, the branch on the left will always be taken.
```C
if (2|(x^2 + x)^T){
...
}
else {
...
}
```


_P<sup>F</sup> - opaquely false predicate_ <br>
The condition is never satisfied, hence "false".
Consider the following example:
```C
if (2 == 3){
...
}
else {
...
}
```
The expression `2 == 3` will never be true, hence the else-statement is always the executed branch.


_P<sup>?</sup> - opaquely intermediate predicate_ <br>
This type of opaque predicate combines the two types above. It is uncertain, which path gets taken since the expression can be true in one case and be false in another case.
```C
if (x mod 2 == 0){
...
}
else {
...
}
```
This code snipplet presents the expression `x mod 2 == 0`, which depending on the value of `x`, can be either true or false.
For example for `x` being equal to 2, the if-statement would be executed, since this would fullfil the condition (2 mod 2 == 0).
On the other hand `x = 4` would not satisfy this condition and the code in the else-block would be executed instead. 


_E<sup>=v</sup> - for an opaque expression of value v_ <br>

### Analysis in Ghidra
Beginning at the address 0x491aa0, one can recognize the high complexity of the control flow graph of this binarys function.

Since the amount is so vast, only a sample set of randomly chosen candidates will be analyzed in further detail.


#### Sample at 0x491b38
<br>
<img src="https://github.com/OpaxIV/hslu_secproj/assets/93701325/ec0d8dde-7edc-4b11-af79-f4d8d884cede" width="900">
<br/>

Three basic blocks compose this opaque predicate.
The first can be seen as the "if-statement", in which the condition gets checked.
Basic block containing a conditional check (starting at 0x491b38):
```asm
                             LAB_00491b38                                    XREF[1]:     00491b1e(j)  
        00491b38 8b 0d 44        MOV        this,dword ptr [DAT_0058dd44]                    = ??
                 dd 58 00
        00491b3e 8b 3d 40        MOV        EDI,dword ptr [DAT_0058dd40]                     = ??
                 dd 58 00
        00491b44 0f af c9        IMUL       this,this
        00491b47 41              INC        this
        00491b48 b8 02 00        MOV        EAX,0x2
                 00 00
        00491b4d 31 d2           XOR        EDX,EDX
        00491b4f f7 f1           DIV        this
        00491b51 89 fa           MOV        EDX,EDI
        00491b53 0f af d2        IMUL       EDX,EDX
        00491b56 83 c2 03        ADD        EDX,0x3
        00491b59 39 d0           CMP        EAX,EDX
        00491b5b 74 3b           JZ         LAB_00491b98
```
The jump occurs if `eax` and `edx` are equal. This is computed by subtracting both values currently resting in the registers and checking the result.
If the result ends up being equal to zero, then the jump occurs. Every other outcome would lead to a continuation of the code at 0x0491b5d.

Interesting to know would be, what the actual if-statement would be like, hence to understand how the values in the registers `eax` and `edx` would look like.
We can somewhat get an idea of this by looking at the decompiler output:
```C
  uVar9 = DAT_0058dd44 * DAT_0058dd44 + 1;
  if ((int)(2 / (ulonglong)uVar9) == DAT_0058dd40 * DAT_0058dd40 + 3) goto LAB_00491b98;
  while( true ) {
    puStack_6c = (uint *)0x491b67;
    ppuStack_34 = &puStack_70;
    puStack_74 = (uint *)0x491b7b;
    ppuVar14 = (uint **)&uStack_78;
    if ((int)(2 / (ulonglong)uVar9) != DAT_0058dd40 * DAT_0058dd40 + 3) break;
LAB_00491b98:
    DAT_0058dd40 = 0;
  }
```
Most notably is the line `if ((int)(2 / (ulonglong)uVar9) == DAT_0058dd40 * DAT_0058dd40 + 3) goto LAB_00491b98;`.
To get a better understanding, we need to simplify this expression. By looking one line above, we can see what the `uVar9` variable stands for.
By substituting `uVar9` with `DAT_0058dd44 * DAT_0058dd44 + 1` we get:
```C
  if ((int)(2 / (ulonglong)DAT_0058dd44 * DAT_0058dd44 + 1) == DAT_0058dd40 * DAT_0058dd40 + 3) goto LAB_00491b98;
```

Rewritten with some examplary variables for better visualisation:
```
x = DAT_0058dd44
y = DAT_0058dd40

if ((2 /  (x * x + 1)) ==  y * y + 3) goto LAB_00491b98;
```

Now we can check this expression using the python tool "z3-solver":

```py
[training@vm ~]$ python
Python 3.11.5 (main, Sep  2 2023, 14:16:33) [GCC 13.2.1 20230801] on linux
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> from z3 import *
>>> x, y = BitVecs('x y', 32)
>>> f = (2 /  (x * x + 1))
>>> g = y * y + 3
>>> f
2/(x*x + 1)
>>> g
y*y + 3
>>> solver = Solver()
>>> solver.add(f == g)
>>> solver.check()
unsat
>>>
```

As we can see, this expression is not satisfiable. So any occurence of `((2 /  (x * x + 1)) ==  y * y + 3)` will lead it to never be true.
This branch can be described as dead weight, since it will never be executed.

So we can conclude, that the conditon is never satisfied and hence the control flow will directly continue onto the adress 0x491b5d.

In this case, not three but four basic blocks compose this opaque predicate.
The first can be seen as the one containing an "if-statement", in which the condition gets checked.
Basic block containing a conditional check (starting at 0x494924):
```asm
                             LAB_00494924                                    XREF[1]:     0049484d(j)  
        00494924 8b 46 28        MOV        EAX,dword ptr [ESI + 0x28]
        00494927 89 46 2c        MOV        dword ptr [ESI + 0x2c],EAX
        0049492a 8b 46 2c        MOV        EAX,dword ptr [ESI + 0x2c]
        0049492d 0f af c0        IMUL       EAX,EAX
        00494930 89 46 2c        MOV        dword ptr [ESI + 0x2c],EAX
        00494933 ff 46 2c        INC        dword ptr [ESI + 0x2c]

                 00 00
        0049493b 31 d2           XOR        EDX,EDX
        0049493d f7 76 2c        DIV        dword ptr [ESI + 0x2c]
        00494940 8b 56 24        MOV        EDX,dword ptr [ESI + 0x24]
        00494943 0f af d2        IMUL       EDX,EDX
        00494946 89 56 2c        MOV        dword ptr [ESI + 0x2c],EDX
        00494949 8d 52 03        LEA        EDX,[EDX + 0x3]
        0049494c 39 d0           CMP        EAX,EDX
        0049494e 0f 84 f7        JZ         LAB_0049554b
                 0b 00 00
        00494954 e9 e3 0b        JMP        LAB_0049553c
                 00 00
```
The jump occurs if `eax` and `edx` are equal. This is computed by subtracting both values currently resting in the registers and checking the result.
If the result ends up being equal to zero, then the jump occurs. Every other outcome would lead to a continuation of the code at 0x0491b5d.

Interesting to know would be, what the actual if-statement would be like, hence to understand how the values in the registers `eax` and `edx` would look like.
We can somewhat get an idea of this by looking at the decompiler output:
```C
LAB_00494924:
      if ((int)(2 / (ulonglong)((int)ppuStack_40 * (int)ppuStack_40 + 1)) ==
          (int)ppuStack_44 * (int)ppuStack_44 + 3) goto LAB_0049554b;
      while ((int)ppuStack_40 * (int)ppuStack_40 * 7 + -1 == (int)ppuStack_44 * (int)ppuStack_44) {
LAB_0049554b:
        uVar9 = (int)ppuStack_40 / (int)((uint)ppuStack_40 / 0) & (uint)ppuStack_40;
        uVar4 = (int)ppuStack_40 * uVar9;
        DAT_00590814 = (uint **)(uVar4 + (uVar9 + uVar4 ^ uVar4));
        ppuStack_40 = DAT_00590814;
      }
```
Most notably is the line `if ((int)(2 / (ulonglong)((int)ppuStack_40 * (int)ppuStack_40 + 1)) == (int)ppuStack_44 * (int)ppuStack_44 + 3) goto LAB_0049554b;`.
To get a better understanding, we need to simplify this expression. We can see that the value is used multiple times before:
<br>
<img src="https://github.com/OpaxIV/hslu_secproj/assets/93701325/b506ab32-2c0d-4811-b68c-ee5941718714" width="500">
<br/>
ust by looking at it, it won't seem that the values of `ppuStack_40` and `ppuStack_44` get drastically changed. They are used in multiple computations but not overwritten in any way.
With this fact in hand, we can just replace and simplify these expressions with examplary values like `x` and `y`.
```C
x =  ppuStack_40
y = ppuStack_44

if ((2 / (x * x + 1)) == y * y + 3) goto LAB_0049554b;
```

Rewritten with some examplary variables for better visualisation:
```
x = DAT_0058dd44
y = DAT_0058dd40

if ((2 /  (x * x + 1)) ==  y * y + 3) goto LAB_00491b98;
```

Now we can check this expression using the python tool "z3-solver":

```py
[training@vm ~]$ python
Python 3.11.5 (main, Sep  2 2023, 14:16:33) [GCC 13.2.1 20230801] on linux
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> from z3 import *
>>> x, y = BitVecs('x y', 32)
>>> f = (2 /  (x * x + 1))
>>> g = y * y + 3
>>> f
2/(x*x + 1)
>>> g
y*y + 3
>>> solver = Solver()
>>> solver.add(f == g)
>>> solver.check()
unsat
>>>
```

As we can see, this expression is not satisfiable. So any occurence of `((2 /  (x * x + 1)) ==  y * y + 3)` will lead it to never be true.
This branch can be described as dead weight, since it will never be executed.

So we can conclude, that the conditon is never satisfied and hence the control flow will directly continue onto the adress 0x491b5d.
